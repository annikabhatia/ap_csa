## Introduction to Java
Basic overview of the Java programming language, its history, and its importance in software development.

## Key Components of a Java Program
Introduction to the basic components of a Java program, including classes, methods, variables, and packages.

## Coding Style, Data Types and Arrays
Best practices for writing clean and maintainable Java code, introduction to different data types available in Java, and usage of arrays.

## Operators and Execution Flow Management
Understanding operators in Java and how they are used to perform various operations, along with managing the flow of execution using control flow statements.

## Real Development with Java
Practical aspects of Java development, including working with IDEs, debugging, and version control systems.

## Encapsulation and Scope
Concepts of encapsulation and scope in Java, understanding access modifiers and how they control the visibility of classes, methods, and variables.

## Inheritance and Interfaces
Introduction to inheritance and interfaces, and how they are used to achieve code reuse and polymorphism in Java.

## Polymorphism
Exploring the concept of polymorphism in Java, including method overriding and dynamic method dispatch.

## Exceptions and Assertions
Handling exceptions and assertions in Java to gracefully manage unexpected situations and errors in the program.

## A Guided Example to OO Programming
A practical example demonstrating object-oriented programming principles such as inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.

## Enumerations and Nested Types
Understanding enumerations and nested types in Java and how they can be used to organize code more effectively.

## Generic Types
Introduction to generic types in Java, allowing for the creation of classes and methods that can operate on different data types while providing type safety.

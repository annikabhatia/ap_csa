# Problem: Reverse Digits of an Integer

Write a function named "reverseDigits" that takes as input a non-negative integer and returns an integer with its digits reversed.

For example, if the integer passed to the function is 12345, the function should return 54321.

Constraints:

The input integer will be non-negative.
The input integer will be within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
Your task is to implement the "reverseDigits" function according to the specified requirements. This problem primarily tests the student's understanding of manipulating integers and their digits, which aligns with the content covered in Unit 1: Primitive Types.

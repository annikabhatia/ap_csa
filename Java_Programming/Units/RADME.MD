# AP Computer Science A

## Unit 1: Primitive Types
    Fundamentals of Java, a programming language, as well as other foundational concepts for coding.
## Unit 2: Using Objects
    Explore reference data as a way to represent real-world objects in a digital world and discover methods to perform more complex operations.
## Unit 3: Boolean Expressions and if Statements
    Delve into the building blocks of algorithms and focus on using conditional statements to solve problems and control results.
## Unit 4: Iteration
    Learn about iteration, another building block of algorithms that are for repetition.
## Unit 5: Writing Classes
    Explore how real-world interactions can be expressed digitally by organizing behaviors and attributes into classes, and you’ll examine the legal and ethical implications of computer programming.
## Unit 6: Array
    Learn techniques and standard algorithms to work with collections of related data, known as data structures.
## Unit 7: ArrayList
    Delve deeper into data sets, exploring ArrayList objects for larger amounts of data, as well as the privacy concerns related to personal data storage.
## Unit 8: 2D Array
    Now that you’ve explored 1D arrays, you’ll branch out into 2D arrays and experiment with data sets represented in a table.
## Unit 9: Inheritance
    Learn how to manipulate programming without altering existing code by using subclasses to create a hierarchy.
## Unit 10: Recursion
    Work on solving larger problems by solving smaller, simpler versions of the same problem using recursive methods.

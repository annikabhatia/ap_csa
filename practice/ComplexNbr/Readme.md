# ComplexNumber Class

# Objective:
The objective of this assignment is to familiarize yourself with the concept of complex numbers and their representation in Java. By the end of this assignment, you should be able to create a Java class representing complex numbers, perform basic operations on them, and explore operator overloading by including scalar operations.

# Instructions:
## ComplexNumber Class Creation:
Create a Java class named ComplexNumber to represent complex numbers.
Your class should have instance variables to store the real and imaginary parts of a complex number.
Implement a constructor method that takes two parameters: real and imaginary parts, and initializes the instance variables accordingly.


## Basic Operations:
Implement methods within the ComplexNumber class to perform the following operations:
- Addition of two complex numbers.
- Subtraction of two complex numbers.
- Multiplication of two complex numbers.
- Division of two complex numbers.
- Absolute value (magnitude) of a complex number.
- Find conjugate of a complex number.
- Addition of a complex number with an integer.
- Multiplication of a complex number with an integer.


## User Interaction:
Write a simple Java program that allows user interaction.
Prompt the user to enter the real and imaginary parts of two complex numbers.
Prompt the user to enter an integer for scalar operations.
Perform each of the basic operations mentioned above using the ComplexNumber class.
Display the results of each operation to the user.
Additional Tasks:
Extend your program to perform any additional operations or functionalities related to complex numbers that you find interesting.
Ensure your code is well-commented and follows best practices for readability and maintainability.

``` Note:
Make sure to handle input validation, especially when accepting real and imaginary parts from the user.
Test your program with various inputs to verify the correctness of the implemented operations.
Explore how operator overloading works in Java by implementing scalar operations.
```

## List of Operations on Complex Numbers:
1. Addition: (a+bi) + (c+di) = (a+c) + (b+d)i
2. Subtraction: (a+bi) - (c+di) = (a-c) + (b-d)i
3. Multiplication: (a+bi) * (c+di) = (ac - bd) + (ad + bc)i
4. Division: (a+bi) / (c+di) = ((ac + bd) / (c^2 + d^2)) + ((bc - ad) / (c^2 + d^2))i
5. Absolute Value (Magnitude): |a+bi| = sqrt(a^2 + b^2)
6. Conjugate: The conjugate of a complex number a+bi is a-bi.
